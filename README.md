# Weekly Challenge 5 - Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The motivation behind this weekly challenge was about helping familiarize ourselves with building dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.  The main goal was to build a workday scheduler that can help organize peoples days by showing different time blocks for past/present/future along with storing user input for each individual hour block.

In this specific challenge, the User Story was: AS AN employee with a busy schedule, I WANT to add important events to a daily planner,  SO THAT I can manage my time effectively. The main acceptance criteria were as follows:

- GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
- WHEN I open the planner
- THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- WHEN I scroll down
- THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
- WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
- THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- WHEN I click into a timeblock
- THEN I can enter an event
- WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
- THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
- WHEN I refresh the page
- THEN the saved events persist

The main goal this would be to create a dynamically responsive web application powered by jQuery to further our skills within third party APIs. Additionally, we can use this knowledge to help us look for jobs in which this may be a required skillset! 

Through this fifth challenge, I learned multiple hands on skils that will be used within the modern software development lifecycle and environment. I was able to use jQuery & Third Party API's to perform this dynamically respsonsive web application which can function both as a personal tool to use but additionally a portfolio piece.

## Usage

To use the main functionality of this page, you will see each hour block associated with a color based off the current time. The three different block colors coordinate with the current time in the upper part of the screent to show you past (grey), present (red), and future (green). Additional functionality comes with being able to enter text within each block for scheduling out your day and then saving that text with the blue save button to the right.
Once saved, you can refresh your browser but still have your saved schedule there for you to see. If you want to clear your schedule, just simply erase the typed text and click save on each time block!
